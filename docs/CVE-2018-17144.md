# A Bitcoin Bug - CVE-2018-17144

## What's Happening
Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.x to 0.16.2 are affected by CVE-2018-17144.

A bug in the Bitcoin Core client could have been abused by malicious miners to create a Denial of Service attack (DoS) as well as create unbounded inflation to Bitcoin! This means that a malicious miner could have made more money than they were allowed to using the same proof of work.

The inflation bug could have been exploited by double spending the same UTXO within the same mined block.

Fortunately, this bug has been caught and has not been exploited. It is highly recommend to read the full disclosure by the Bitcoin Core team and upgrade any nodes that you have to 0.16.3.
