## What is th3build?

This is the 3rd Industrial Revolution, built using blockchain, ai, and iot. We're creating a new economic paradigm that enables a new age of entrepreneurship and innovation.

This isn't being done by a company, it's a movement of individuals building this themselves. Using the technology around them to reorganize the world to meet our raised expectations. We'll create an unprecedent level of abundance that provides for our needs, enabling us to take what we need when we need it, so we can put full brainpower towards our most ambitious aspirations.

Together, we'll pass down a new standard of living for generations to come.

Come to the table, let's get started.

## What's the 3rd Industrial Revolution?
> "Energy is the material basis for human survival and development. . . .
> 1.  The first industrial revolution, from 1770 to 1860, . . . . . . was built on Coal in England. . . .
> 2.  The second industrial revolution, from 1910 to 2010, . . . . . . was built on Electricity in United States. . . .
> 3.  The third industrial revolution, . . . . . . will be built on Renewable Energy and Energy Internet."

We're moving towards a new paradigm of abundant energy. Once we build solar panels and windmills, we'll be able to harness a free energy source that can be used to power a new level of automation, customized to our desired standard of living.

## We're a Community

This is a movement. 

To showcase a new culture of soverignty and spotlight exciting initiatives. 

We have these tools laying at our feet that are capable of building the infrastructure to transition our hometowns into smart-cities. We're the dreamers of utopia who picked up the wrench and got to work. We don't need to ask permission, anyone can rally a community and begin building the infrastructure of abundance and hyper-opportunity. When one of us succeeds, it inspires the next to copy and paste with their own local flair. By solving problems locally, we get tangible experience and become experts and knowledge leaders of this evolution.

## Our Swarmwise Strategy

In aggregate, no problem is outside our scope. When someone discovers a solution locally, anyone across the world can copy/paste. This means solutions discovered at the local level can be copy/pasted infinitely as it scales across the world, creating global macro-effects.

You'll need this.*


## Our First Goal

**Globally stop using carbon fuels by 2040**

To begin this next industrial revolution, we'll first need a new energy source. One that's accessible everywhere. ðŸŒ¤

Luckily the sun and wind don't charge an energy bill, it's free to anyone with solar panels and windmills. This empowers local communities to be energy independent, not reliant on outside institutions to maintain reliable power to their community.

To show the world we mean business, let's tackle the one everyone complains about: global warming ðŸ¤¯

While we begin to deploy the initial energy infrastructure for our industrial revolution, we'll simultaneously remove dependence from carbon based fuels, making it obselete. We figure out how to quickly deploy panels in our communities, and copy/paste the best solutions across the world.

But this is just the first step. Once we have an abundant energy source, we'll begin deploying new infrastructure powered by this free energy.

## But before: some background research

This next industrial revolution relies heavily on cutting edge technology to deliver a radically improved standard of living. The core of these technologies are: 

	ðŸ¤– IoT to efficiently move the real world around us (think delivery drones)
	ðŸ§  AI to coordinate massive data coming in from these devices and make smart decisions
	â›“ Blockchain to coordinate the software transparently and securely.

This repository will help you learn the underlying technology so you can begin deploying critical infrastructure in your hometown that progresses this evolution across the world.

?> Get started by clicking links in the sidebar. To begin making your communities self-sustainable, you have to figure it out for yourself first. Begin rebuilding the institutions that you'll pass down for generations to come. Institutions that are acessible across the world, transparent, and serve the needs of their patrons vs their pocket.
