## Ads Suck

Let's be honest. No one likes waiting on youtube ads, or scrolling past paywalls on news articles. It's a terrible experience.

It's the bargin we've made to make the internet profitable for content creators. The best way at monetizing our eyeballs watching videos is to serve ads in-between the content. This is what pays for the videos and publications that we consume for free.

But there must be an alternative.

## AdBlock Everything

For the slightly savvy of you. Experiencing an adfree internet experience is actually quite easy. Simply install a plugin and BOOM â€“ no more ads.

**Oh wait.**

We just removed the primary revenue source for the youtube videos we watch and articles we read.

*Back to the drawing Board*

## Patreon

For those unaware of Patreon, it's a platform for subscription donations. For example, science animation channel Kurzgesagt has over 11,000 patrons who donates at least $1 (or more) each month. 

This allow content creators to setup their own basic income, by crowdfunding their income from their fans each month.

But let's take further.

## Blockchain Patreon

What if you signed up for a subscription of donating $5 a month.

That $5 would be distributed to the websites you visited that month, weighted how long you view their content.

Thus, you could give an aggregate of $5 a month as small micropayments of a few pennies each to the websites you visit. 

All of this would happen in the background without you noticing (except for the initial deposit of $5).

*cough*

This exists. It's a real product and works.

## Brave Browser

The Brave Browser has built in ad-blocking and tracking. It's a fork of chrome so it's similar to what you might be used too, except with built-in tools to maintain your privacy.

Within the browser is a wallet that holds Basic Attention Tokens (BAT). These tokens are distributed to the websites you visit, anonymously.

Thus, as you're browsing the web ad-free, your favorite websites and content creators can do what they love doing most â€“ giving you content. We can get rid of Ads as a parasite and bring closer the relationships between ourselves and our favorite creators.
